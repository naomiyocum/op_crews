# Relational Rails

### Solo Project for Mod 2

### Learning Goals
* Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
* Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources.
* Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers.
* Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior.

Below is my design for the one-to-many relationship we were to create for this project. Influenced my One Piece (great anime btw), a crew has many characters and a character belongs to a crew.
